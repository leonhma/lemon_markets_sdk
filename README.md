This is a Python SDK for accessing the Lemon Markets API.
API documentation can be found here: [lemon-markets-sdk.readthedocs.io](https://lemon-markets-sdk.readthedocs.io/)

> [lemon.markets](https://lemon.markets) is in closed beta and this SDK is a work in progress. 
> Pull requests to expand the SDK or improve its reliability are welcomed.

## Installation

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/LinusReuter/lemon_markets_sdk.git
```

Open the downloaded folder, and install the package with this command:

```
pip install .
```

Or, if you want to make changes to the package's source code (If you want to work on this repo, for example):

```
pip install . -e
```

The second option installs the package via a dynamic link, meaning your changes to the package will immediately be reflected by the program using it.


## Usage

### Authentication

For getting started the account must be initialized. 
The account is needed for further requests.
Your access_token is automatically updated when it expires.

```python
from lemon_markets.account import Account

#The third argument is optional (default value displayed) and sets the structure 
# to change to real money trading when supported by the API (trading_type='money'). 
account = Account(your_client_id, your_client_secret, trading_type='paper')

#for seeing your accsess token
print(account.access_token)

```

### State and Space


```python
from lemon_markets.state import State

state = State(account)

#get the balance of the state (all money not given to spaces)
print(state.balance) 

#get your space (because your client ID is linked to a Space the request "list Spaces" only contains one space.)
space = state.spaces[0]
print(space.state) #the state of the space as dict like in the API response.
#the elements of the state as floats:
print(space.balance)
print(space.cash_to_invest)

```

### Instruments

```python
from lemon_markets.instrument import *

# getting a list of all Instruments matching the query params 
# (all arguments are an option and not needed)
instruments = Instruments(account).list_instruments(tradable=true / false, search="Name/Title, WKN, Symbol or ISIN",
                                                    currency="", type="one of the following:"("stock", "bond", "fund",
                                                                                              "ETF" or "warrant"))

# get a singe instrument by isin:
instrument = Instruments(account).get_instrument(isin="")

# to get the information of an instrument use:
instrument.isin
instrument.wkn
instrument.name
instrument.title
instrument.type
instrument.symbol
instrument.currency
instrument.tradable
instrument.trading_venues

```

### Time Helper
All times in this library are stored as timezone aware datetime objects. 
Furthermore, datetime objects are needed for passing a time to a library function, such as creating an order.

```python
from lemon_markets.helpers.time_helper import *

current_time()  # returns the current time as a timezone aware datetime object.

# all params require an integer and are optional. If parameter is not set the current year/month/... is used. 
# Returns a timezone aware datetime object. 
time(year=, month=, day=, hour=, minute=, second=)

# mostly for internal use:
datetime_to_timestamp_seconds(datetime)  # creates an UTC timestamp from the given datetime objects. 
timestamp_seconds_to_datetime(timestamp)  # creates an datetime object with local timezone from the given UTC timestamp.

```


### Orders

```python
from lemon_markets.order import *

# Initialize the Orders Class
orders = Orders(account=acc, space=space)
print(orders.orders)  # see all created and retrieved orders sorted in dicts by status. 
# the Structure of the orders.orders dict:
# {'INACTIVE': {'order_uuid': Order}, 
#  'ACTIVATED': {'order_uuid': Order}, 
#  'IN_PROGRESS': {'order_uuid': Order}, 
#  'EXECUTED': {'order_uuid': Order}, 
#  'DELETED': {'order_uuid': Order}, 
#  'EXPIRED': {'order_uuid': Order}}

# create an order:
order = orders.create_order(instrument=, valid_until=, quantity=,
                            side=)  # creates and order stores it in the orders.orders dict and returns the order

# activate an order:
orders.activate_order(order)

# update the status and data of an order:
orders.update_order(order)

# delete an order:
orders.delete_order(order)

# fill the orders.orders dict by listing your orders
orders.get_orders(created_at_until=, created_at_from=, side=, type=, status=)  # all params optional

# clean the orders.orders dict:
orders.clean_orders()  # removes all executed, deleted or expired orders in the orders dict

```

### Trading Venues

```python
from lemon_markets.trading_venue import *

venues = TradingVenues(acc)  # initialisation
venues.get_venues()  # requests all venues and saves them internally in a list reachable under venues.trading_venues
xmun = venues.trading_venues[0]  #get the first (and right now only) trading venue

#Informations a trading venue can return
xmun.name  # returns the name (Börse München - Gettex)
xmun.mic  # returns the mic (XMUN)
xmun.is_open  # returns a bool 
xmun.time_until_open  # returns a datetime timedelta (only considers the current day, if the venue is already open or has closed the timedelta will be negative until the next morning. (no restart necessary))
xmun.time_until_close  # returns a datetime timedelta (only considers the current day, if the venue has already closed the timedelta will be negative until the next morning. (no restart necessary))

```

### Market Data

#### OHLC

```python
from lemon_markets.market_data import OHLC

ohlc = OHLC(account=acc)  # initialisation

# requests OHLC_Data 
# by default the data is returned as a dataframe with the time as a aware datetime object as index respecting the given ordering parameter.
# if the as_df param is set to False, the function returns the results unedited in the list given by the API response. 
data = ohlc.get_data(instrument=, venue=, x1=,
                     # these are nessesary params. instrument and venue must be an instance of the corresponding class
                     date_from=None, date_until=None, ordering=None,
                     as_df=True)  # these params are optional (default values are displayed here)

```
